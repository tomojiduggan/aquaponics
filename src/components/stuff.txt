                  <h1>Nitrogen Cycle</h1>
                  <p>The nitrogen cycle is an essential part of nature which makes nitrogen recycling
                    possible. It it seperated in these following steps:
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Nitrification</li>
                    <li>Assimilation</li>
                    <li>Ammonification</li>
                    <li>Denitrification</li>
                  </ol>
                  <h2>Nitrification</h2>
                  <p>Nitrification is the transformation of the present ammonia excreted by animals
                    into nitrites. This is done by decomposition by various bacterias with the following
                    chemical formulas<br/>
                    {/* 2NH4+ + 3O2 → 2NO2– + 4H+ + 2H2O */}
                    <strong>2NH<sub>4</sub> + 3O<sub>2</sub> -{'>'} 2NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> + 4H<sup>+</sup> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O</strong><br/>
                    {/* 2NO2– + O2 → 2NO3– */}
                    <strong>2NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> + O<sub>2</sub> -{'>'} 2NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup></strong>
                  </p>
                  <h2>Assimilation</h2>
                  <p>Plants absorb the present nitrogen, particularly nitrites in order to grow. Animals get it by either eating plants or eating other animals.</p>
                  <h2>Ammonification</h2>
                  <p>Whenever a plant of animal dies, the nitrogen within their system gets released back into nature and gets decomposed into ammonia by varius fungi and bacteria.</p>
                  <h2>Denitrification</h2>
                  <p>Nitrites present in the soil are, turned into nitrogen gaz and oxygen. Various species use this in order to have a supply of oxygen.</p>

                  <h1>How the nitrogen cycle works in aquaponics</h1>
                  <p>In aquaponic systems, the nitrogen cycle behaves similarly to how it does in nature,
                    with fish, plants and bacteria.</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>The fish excrete ammonia into the water</li>
                    <li>Nitrosomonas, a type of bacteria digests ammonia into nitrites</li>
                    <li>The nitrites then get digested once again by a species of bacteria named nitrospira, turning it into nitrates</li>
                    <li>The plants absorb the nitrate present in the water, as it is one of its essential nutrients.</li>

                  <h1>The advantages of aquaponics</h1>
                  <h2>Less water consumption</h2>
                  <p>Surprisingly, aquaponics uses about 90% less water than conventional farming
                    This is because the water present in the system has a much lower surface area,
                    having less of it be wasted by evaporation.
                  </p>
                  <p>Aquaponics consumes 90% less water than regular farming</p>
                  <h2>Faster plant growth</h2>
                  <p>Growing plants in water instead of soil can speed up their growth
                      by twofolds. It is easier for them to absorb nutrients from water
                      than in soil.
                  </p>
                  <h2>No use of pesticides</h2>
                  <p>Whenever you eat a plant that grew from an aquaponic system, you can
                    guarantee that no pesticide was used in it because if it was used,
                    it would result in the fish in the system dying.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Conclusion: Highly efficient</h2>
                  <p>With these list of advantages, we can deduct that aquaponics is an
                    efficient way of growing food, growing more, does not contaminate and uses
                    much less water, making it a good environmental choice.
